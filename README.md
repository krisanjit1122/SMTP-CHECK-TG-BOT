# SMTP-CHECK-TG-BOT
â€¢ Code Explanation

The code above demonstrates how to create a Telegram bot in Python that can validate SMTP servers based on the information provided by the user.

First, we import the necessary libraries: telebot for interacting with the Telegram API and smtplib for connecting to the SMTP servers.

Next, we define the Telegram bot token that you need to obtain from the BotFather. Replace 'your_telegram_bot_token' with your actual bot token.

We create a new instance of the bot using the token.

The handle_document function is a message handler that will be triggered whenever a document is sent to the bot. It checks if the document is a .txt file and then proceeds to download and process it.

The file content is converted to a string and split into lines. Each line represents the SMTP server information in the format host|port|user|pass.

We iterate over the lines and split each line by the '|' character to extract the host, port, user, and password.

We then try to connect to the SMTP server using the smtplib.SMTP class and the provided credentials. If the connection is successful, we consider the SMTP server valid and send the information back to the user in the format host, port, user, password.

If the connection fails due to invalid credentials, we simply ignore the server and move on to the next one.

Finally, we start the bot using the bot.polling() method, which continuously checks for new messages and triggers the appropriate handlers.

With this code, you can create a Telegram bot that validates SMTP servers based on user-provided information.
